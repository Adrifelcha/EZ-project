# Hierarchical Bayesian EZ-DDM!

Welcome,

This repository contains all code needed to replicate the results reported throughout the various simulation studies and appendices in Ch√°vez De la Pena and Vandekerckhove (2024).

- `/code/` This folder contains all the R scripts and functions needed to conduct a full simulation study. It contains two sub-folders:

    - `/code/functions/` : R scripts containing specific custom functions
    
    - `/code/scripts/` : R scripts containing higher-lefel functions that call mutliple specific custom functions to execute a full routine.

- `/examples/` This folder contains the code needed to replicate the analysis and figures presented in Apendices B and C.

    - `/examples/brightness_perception/` : Materials related to the applied example in Appendix C.
    
    - `/examples/shape_perception/` : Materials related to the applied example in Appendix B.

- `/simulations/` This folder contains many sub-folders to store the specific functions and scripts, as well as the output for different simulation studies.

    - `/simulations/generative_priors` : Six simulation studies where we use generative priors to sample true hierarchical parameters.
    
    - `/simulations/params_from_uniforms` : Six simulation studies where true hierarchical parameters are sampled from generative uniform distributions.
    
    - `/simulations/within-subject_ttest` : 

- `/figures/` This folder contains all figures included in the paper
