# Hierarchical Bayesian EZ-DDM!

Welcome,

This repository contains all code needed to replicate the results reported throughout the various simulation studies and appendices in Ch√°vez De la Pena and Vandekerckhove (2024).

- `/code/` This folder contains all the R scripts and functions needed to conduct a full simulation study. It contains two sub-folders:

    - `/code/functions/` : R scripts containing specific custom functions
    
    - `/code/scripts/` : R scripts containing higher-lefel functions that call mutliple specific custom functions to execute a full routine.

- `/examples/` This folder contains the code needed to replicate the analysis and figures presented in Apendices B and C.
