Attempted to study the scientific correlation between two things. Any correlational experiment can only be regarded as a sample and presents a certain amount of accidental deviation from the real general tendency. Accidental deviation can be measured by the 'probable error.' Accidental deviation depends on the number or cases, and on the largeness of existing correspondence. Probable error varies according to the method of calculation. While the number of Ss helps to reduce accidental deviation, it has no effect upon systematic deviation, except that it indirectly leads to an augmentation. Therefore, the number of cases should be determined by the principle that the measurements to be aggregated together should have their error brought to the same general order of magnitude. Suggests that probable errors must be kept down to limits small enough for the particular object of investigation to be proved. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)},

	abstract = {A theory is proposed to account for some of the age-related differences reported in measures of Type A or fluid cognition. The central hypothesis in the theory is that increased age in adulthood is associated with a decrease in the speed with which many processing operations can be executed and that this reduction in speed leads to impairments in cognitive functioning because of what are termed the limited time mechanism and the simultaneity mechanism. That is, cognitive performance is degraded when processing is slow because relevant operations cannot be successfully executed (limited time) and because the products of early processing may no longer be available when later processing is complete (simultaneity). Several types of evidence, such as the discovery of considerable shared age-related variance across various measures of speed and large attenuation of the age-related influences on cognitive measures after statistical control of measures of speed, are consistent with this theory.},

Cognitive deficits associated with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (AD/HD) were examined by using delta-plot analyses of performance data (reaction time and accuracy) obtained through the use of a prototypical conflict task, the Eriksen flanker task. In 20 children with AD/HD (compared with matched control participants), overall performance measures indicated a marginal performance deficit. Delta-plot analyses indicated that performance deficits associated with AD/HD involve response inhibition but not automatic response activation. In a within-subjects titration study, the response inhibition deficit was eliminated by methylphenidate treatment, but these effects were highly dose specific. The beneficial effect of methylphenidate was clarified further after correcting for inter-individual variation in sensitivity to medicine dosage.

The theory proposes that a control signal, such as an external stop signal or an error during performance, starts a stopping process that races against the processes underlying ongoing thought and action. If the stopping process wins, thought and action are inhibited; if the ongoing process wins, thought and action run on to completion. The theory is formally developed to account for many aspects of performance in situations with explicit stop signals, and it is applied to data obtained from 3 adult observers in a series of RT tasks. The relation between response inhibition and other acts of control in motor performance and in cognition is discussed, and the implications of the theory are considered in terms of current thinking about attentional control and automaticity.

	abstract = {In a speeded choice reaction time task, responses to centrally presented letter targets can be altered by the identity of surrounding task-irrelevant letters (flankers). In the standard flanker effect, flankers associated with the same response as the target lead to faster and more accurate responses, whereas flankers associated with a different response lead to slower and more error-prone responses. B. A. Eriksen and C. W. Eriksen (1974, pp. 143–149) have argued that these flanker effects occur through response competition. We present data from a novel version of the Eriksen task, in which some targets and flankers consist of letter forms that aremorphed versions of target letters. In this paradigm, flankers induce classic flanker effects on well-formed targets. But flankers induce an opposite effect, termed anegative flanker effect on morphed letter targets. For example, targets that are morphs between the letters “A” and “H” are more likely to be identified as an “A” when flanked by an “H.” The interpretation advanced here is that there are two distinct kinds of flanker effects: contrast enhancement in perceptual processes and response competition in response selection processes.},

	doi = {10.1037/xlm0000431},
	abstract = {The association between working memory capacity (WMC) and the antisaccade task, which requires subjects to move their eyes and attention away from a strong visual cue, supports the claim that WMC is partially an attentional construct (Kane, Bleckley, Conway, \& Engle, 2001; Unsworth, Schrock, \& Engle, 2004). Specifically, the WMC-antisaccade relation suggests that WMC helps maintain and execute task goals despite interference from habitual actions. Related work has recently shown that mind wandering (McVay \& Kane, 2009, 2012a, 2012b) and reaction time (RT) variability (Unsworth, 2015) are also related to WMC and they partially explain WMC’s prediction of cognitive abilities. Here, we tested whether mind-wandering propensity and intraindividual RT variation account for WMC’s associations with 2 antisaccade-cued choice RT tasks. In addition, we asked whether any influences of WMC, mind wandering, or intraindividual RT variation on antisaccade are moderated by (a) the temporal gap between fixation and the flashing location cue, and (b) whether targets switch sides on consecutive trials. Our quasi-experimental study reexamined a published dataset (Kane et al., 2016) comprising 472 subjects who completed 6 WMC tasks, 5 attentional tasks with mind-wandering probes, 5 tasks from which we measured intraindividual RT variation, and 2 antisaccade tasks with varying fixation-cue gap durations. The WMC-antisaccade association was not accounted for by mind wandering or intraindividual RT variation. WMC’s effects on antisaccade performance were greater with longer fixation-to-cue intervals, suggesting that goal activation processes—beyond the ability to control mind wandering and RT variability—are partially responsible for the WMC-antisaccade relation.

They tested high- and low-span individuals on variants of prosaccade and antisaccade trials in which an eye movement is the sole requirement. In 3 experiments, they demonstrated the importance of WM span differences in both suppression of a reflexive saccade and generation of a volitional eye movement.

The present study investigated whether Stroop test interference, defined as the cost associated with ink-color naming in the incongruous stimulus condition versus in the basic color-naming condition, provides positive evidence for a kind of processing qualitatively different than that which is required for color naming or for word reading. Does the pattern of age-related differences in Stroop interference force the conclusion that the incongruous condition taps a qualitatively different kind of processing than that required for color naming or for word reading? We gave the CWST to 310 healthy adults. Their performance in each condition of the test replicates and extends previous findings. Structural equation modeling of the data showed a significant, direct link between age and performance in the latent factor associated with the incongruent condition. However, this direct link with age produced a relatively small increase in the model's fit; it amounted to only a .024 increase in the proportion of variance explained in the incongruent condition. In light of this small direct influence due to age, the most parsimonious explanation of our findings is that age effects in Stroop interference are due to age-related slowing (which is also indexed by color naming and by word reading) primarily; the findings do not provide positive evidence for a qualitatively different kind of processing that declines with age.},

This leads to the prediction that the size of these effects should correlate across cognitive control tasks. To this end, we conducted three large-scale individual differences experiments to examine whether the SCE and ERS effect are correlated across Simon, Flanker, and Stroop tasks. Across all experiments, the results revealed a correlation for the error-related slowing effect, but not for the sequential congruency effect across tasks.

The models include one level of manifest variables and two or more levels of latent variables. It is the advantage of this framework that a few characteristic models can be adapted to a large number of structures by minor modifi-cations. Cross-sectional and longitudinal approaches are suggested for investigating different aspects of the person-situation issue. While the cross-sectional approach is concerned with behavior in different situations, the longitudinal approach deals with behavior observed at different occasions. Structural equation modeling provides the framework for the formal representation of these models. Some models are applied for investigating the structure of social optimism. For a sample of N=462 participants it is demonstrated that the model including three first-order latent variables and one second-order latent variable provides an appropriate representation of the data.},

However, individual differences in reaction times do not represent individual differences in a single cognitive process but in multiple cognitive processes. Thus, it is unclear whether the association between mental speed and intelligence reflects advantages in a specific cognitive process or in general processing speed. In this article, we present a neurocognitive-psychometrics account of mental speed that decomposes the relationship between mental speed and intelligence. We summarize research employing mathematical models of cognition and chronometric analyses of neural processing to identify distinct stages of information processing strongly related to intelligence differences. Evidence from both approaches suggests that the speed of higher-order processing is greater in smarter individuals, which may reflect advantages in the structural and functional organization of brain networks. Adopting a similar neurocognitive-psychometrics approach for other cognitive processes associated with intelligence (e.g., working memory or executive control) may refine our understanding of the basic cognitive processes of intelligence.},

Recent results indicated that especially latencies of ERP components associated with higher-order processing (P2, N2, and P3) may share up to 80\% of variance with individual differences in intelligence. WMC has a similar predictive power and thus these two processes cannot explain individual differences in intelligence independently. The current study explores in how far individual differences in executive functions (EFs) may bridge the gap between WMC and PS as predictors of intelligence. We recruited 101 participants who completed three EF tasks – one for each of the three executive functions shifting, updating, and inhibition. Additionally, we assessed participants' intelligence, WMC, and PS. Results showed that only variance of behavioral RTs consistent across manipulations in the EF tasks was related to WMC, PS, and intelligence. The variance specific to the manipulations in EF tasks was small and showed no consistent correlations with each other or with any of the three covariates. These results suggest that EF tasks capture mostly manipulation-unspecific cognitive processes. Hence, individual differences in the impairment due to additional executive processing demands cannot explain why WMC and PS are related predictors of individual differences in intelligence.},

Normal prior distributions for factor loadings and inverse gamma prior distributions for residual variances are a popular choice because of their conditionally conjugate form. However, such prior distributions require elicitation of many hyperparameters and tend to rsult in poorly behaved Gibbs samplers. In addition, one must choose an informative specification, as high variance prior distributions face problems due to impropriety of the posterior distribution. This article proposes a default, heavy-tailed prior distribution specification, which is induced through parameter expansion while facilitating efficient posterior computation. We also develop an approach to allow uncertainty in the number of factors. The methods are illustrated through simulated examples and epidemiology and toxicology applications.

In the context of a new theoretical framework that we have been developing (the unity/diversity framework), we describe four general conclusions that have emerged. Specifically, we argue that individual differences in EFs, as measured with simple laboratory tasks, (a) show both unity and diversity (different EFs are correlated yet separable), (b) reflect substantial genetic contributions, (c) are related to various clinically and societally important phenomena, and (d) show some developmental stability.},

The current studies examined the hypothesis that taxing working memory beyond some threshold can result in decreased inhibition, resembling the errors committed by patients with prefrontal dysfunctions. Across 3 studies, 70 nonpatient subjects were tested on the antisaccade (AS) task (D. Guitton et al, 1985)—a task sensitive to inhibitory deficits. Subjects were required to look in the opposite direction of a flashed cue, inhibiting the reflexive tendency to saccade to the cue. Subjects performed concurrent tasks that varied working-memory load. The results indicated that conditions with the highest working-memory load produced inhibitory errors comparable to patients with prefrontal dysfunctions. The findings are discussed in terms of the interaction between working memory and the inhibition of prepotent responses. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Other studies proposed that there are several subclasses of illusions, such as illusions of linear extent or distortions. We previously observed strong within-illusion correlations but only weak between-illusion correlations, arguing in favor of an even higher multifactorial space with—more or less—each illusion making up its own factor. These mixed results are surprising. Here, we examined to what extent individual differences in the perception of visual illusions are stable across eyes, time, and measurement methods. First, we did not find any significant differences in the magnitudes of the seven illusions tested with monocular or binocular viewing conditions. In addition, illusion magnitudes were not significantly predicted by visual acuity. Second, we observed stable individual differences over time. Last, we compared two illusion measurements, namely an adjustment procedure and a method of constant stimuli, which both led to similar individual differences. Hence, it is unlikely that the individual differences in the perception of visual illusions arise from instability across eyes, time, and measurement methods.},

However, extant work in this area has been limited by failure to account for the unity and diversity of EFs, focus on only a single measure of bias and/or EF, and relatively small sample sizes. The current study sought to comprehensively model the relation between individual differences in EFs and the expression of racial bias in 3 commonly used laboratory measures. Participants (N = 485) completed a battery of EF tasks (Session 1) and 3 racial bias tasks (Session 2), along with numerous individual difference questionnaires. The main findings were as follows: (a) measures of implicit bias were only weakly intercorrelated; (b) EF and estimates of automatic processes both predicted implicit bias and also interacted, such that the relation between automatic processes and bias expression was reduced at higher levels of EF; (c) specific facets of EF were differentially associated with overall task performance and controlled processing estimates across different bias tasks; (d) EF did not moderate associations between implicit and explicit measures of bias; and (e) external, but not internal, motivation to control prejudice depended on EF to reduce bias expression. Findings are discussed in terms of the importance of global and specific EF abilities in determining expression of implicit racial bias. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)},

Three psychometric models were fit to the data—one including no time-limit effect, one including a fixed time-limit effect, and one including a random effect of time limits. The latter model best fit the data, suggesting that a speed dimension, the random effect of time limits, is needed to account for time-limited responses.

To write a chapter giving an overview of the field is challenging, for the study of individual differences includes the study of affect, behavior, cognition, and motivation as they are affected by biological causes and environmental events. That is, it includes all of psychology. But it is also the study of individual differences that are not normally taught in psychology departments. Human factors, differences in physical abilities as diverse as taste, smell, or strength are also part of the study of differential psychology. Differential psychology requires a general knowledge of all of psychology; for people (as well as chimpanzees, dogs, rats, and fishes) differ in many ways. Thus differential psychologists do not say that they are cognitive psychologists, social psychologists, neuro-psychologists, behavior geneticists, psychometricians, or methodologists; for, although we do those various hyphenated parts of psychology, by saying that we study differential psychology we have said we do all of those things. And that is true for everyone reading this handbook. We study differential psychology: individual differences in how we think, individual differences in how we feel, individual differences in what we want and what we need, individual differences in what we do. We study how people differ, and we also study why people differ. We study individual differences. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)},

	abstract = {The ability to regulate behavior in service of long-term goals is a widely studied psychological construct known as self-regulation. This wide interest is in part due to the putative relations between self-regulation and a range of real-world behaviors. Self-regulation is generally viewed as a trait, and individual differences are quantified using a diverse set of measures, including self-report surveys and behavioral tasks. Accurate characterization of individual differences requires measurement reliability, a property frequently characterized in self-report surveys, but rarely assessed in behavioral tasks. We remedy this gap by (i) providing a comprehensive literature review on an extensive set of self-regulation measures and (ii) empirically evaluating test–retest reliability of this battery in a new sample. We find that dependent variables (DVs) from self-report surveys of self-regulation have high test–retest reliability, while DVs derived from behavioral tasks do not. This holds both in the literature and in our sample, although the test–retest reliability estimates in the literature are highly variable. We confirm that this is due to differences in between-subject variability. We also compare different types of task DVs (e.g., model parameters vs. raw response times) in their suitability as individual difference DVs, finding that certain model parameters are as stable as raw DVs. Our results provide greater psychometric footing for the study of self-regulation and provide guidance for future studies of individual differences in this domain.},

	abstract = {Background
Studies testing for individual or group differences in executive functioning can be compromised by unknown test-retest reliability.
New method
Test-retest reliabilities across an interval of about one week were obtained from performance in the antisaccade, flanker, Simon, and color-shape switching tasks. There is a general trade-off between the greater reliability of single mean RT measures, and the greater process purity of measures based on contrasts between mean RTs in two conditions. The individual differences in RT model recently developed by Miller and Ulrich was used to evaluate the trade-off.
Results
Test-retest reliability was statistically significant for 11 of the 12 measures, but was of moderate size, at best, for the difference scores. The test-retest reliabilities for the Simon and flanker interference scores were lower than those for switching costs.
Comparison with existing methods
Standard practice evaluates the reliability of executive-functioning measures using split-half methods based on data obtained in a single day. Our test-retest measures of reliability are lower, especially for difference scores. These reliability measures must also take into account possible day effects that classical test theory assumes do not occur.
Conclusions
Measures based on single mean RTs tend to have acceptable levels of reliability and convergent validity, but are “impure” measures of specific executive functions. The individual differences in RT model shows that the impurity problem is worse than typically assumed. However, the “purer” measures based on difference scores have low convergent validity that is partly caused by deficiencies in test-retest reliability.},

In Experiment 1, data were collected from 251 adult volunteers drawn from a broad cross-section of the normal population. Word length and phonological similarity in both presentation modes significantly influenced the group means. However, 43\% of the subjects failed to show at least one of the effects, and the likelihood that effects appeared was highly correlated with verbal memory span. In Experiment 2, 40 subjects of the original sample were retested, 20 of whom had failed to show one or more effects in Experiment 1. Whether or not an effect had appeared for individual subjects on the first test session was a poor predictor of whether the effect would appear on retest. Finally, an analysis of subject reports demonstrated that the patterns of experimental data could be accounted for in part by the strategies that subjects reported using, and the effect of strategy was independent of the effect of span. The implications of these findings for theories of verbal short-term memory are discussed.},

At the same time, it has been subdivided into inhibition of prepotent responses (i.e., the ability to stop dominant responses) and resistance to distracter interference (i.e., the ability to ignore distracting information). The present study investigated the unity and diversity of inhibition as a psychometric construct, and tested the hypothesis of an inhibition deficit in older age. We measured inhibition in young and old adults with 11 established laboratory tasks: antisaccade, stop-signal, color Stroop, number Stroop, arrow flanker, letter flanker, Simon, global-local, positive and negative compatibility tasks, and n-2 repetition costs in task switching. In both age groups, the inhibition measures from individual tasks had good reliabilities, but correlated only weakly among each other. Structural equation modeling identified a 2-factor model with factors for inhibition of prepotent responses and resistance to distracter interference. Older adults scored worse in the inhibition of prepotent response, but better in the resistance to distracter interference. However, the model had low explanatory power. Together, these findings call into question inhibition as a psychometric construct and the hypothesis of an inhibition deficit in older age.

	abstract = {One of the most important methodological problems in psychological research is assessing the reasonableness of null models, which typically constrain a parameter to a specific value such as zero. Bayes factor has been recently advocated in the statistical and psychological literature as a principled means of measuring the evidence in data for various models, including those where parameters are set to specific values. Yet, it is rarely adopted in substantive research, perhaps because of the difficulties in computation. Fortunately, for this problem, the Savage–Dickey density ratio (Dickey \& Lientz, 1970) provides a conceptually simple approach to computing Bayes factor. Here, we review methods for computing the Savage–Dickey density ratio, and highlight an improved method, originally suggested by Gelfand and Smith (1990) and advocated by Chib (1995), that outperforms those currently discussed in the psychological literature. The improved method is based on conditional quantities, which may be integrated by Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling to estimate Bayes factors. These conditional quantities efficiently utilize all the information in the MCMC chains, leading to accurate estimation of Bayes factors. We demonstrate the method by computing Bayes factors in one-sample and one-way designs, and show how it may be implemented in WinBUGS.},

One hundred thirty-seven college students performed a set of relatively simple experimental tasks that are considered to predominantly tap each target executive function as well as a set of frequently used executive tasks: the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST), Tower of Hanoi (TOH), random number generation (RNG), operation span, and dual tasking. Confirmatory factor analysis indicated that the three target executive functions are moderately correlated with one another, but are clearly separable. Moreover, structural equation modeling suggested that the three functions contribute differentially to performance on complex executive tasks. Specifically, WCST performance was related most strongly to Shifting, TOH to Inhibition, RNG to Inhibition and Updating, and operation span to Updating. Dual task performance was not related to any of the three target functions. These results suggest that it is important to recognize both the unity and diversity of executive functions and that latent variable analysis is a useful approach to studying the organization and roles of executive functions.},

	abstract = {Individual differences in cognitive paradigms are increasingly employed to relate cognition to brain structure, chemistry, and function. However, such efforts are often unfruitful, even with the most well established tasks. Here we offer an explanation for failures in the application of robust cognitive paradigms to the study of individual differences. Experimental effects become well established – and thus those tasks become popular – when between-subject variability is low. However, low between-subject variability causes low reliability for individual differences, destroying replicable correlations with other factors and potentially undermining published conclusions drawn from correlational relationships. Though these statistical issues have a long history in psychology, they are widely overlooked in cognitive psychology and neuroscience today. In three studies, we assessed test-retest reliability of seven classic tasks: Eriksen Flanker, Stroop, stop-signal, go/no-go, Posner cueing, Navon, and Spatial-Numerical Association of Response Code (SNARC). Reliabilities ranged from 0 to .82, being surprisingly low for most tasks given their common use. As we predicted, this emerged from low variance between individuals rather than high measurement variance. In other words, the very reason such tasks produce robust and easily replicable experimental effects – low between-participant variability – makes their use as correlational tools problematic. We demonstrate that taking such reliability estimates into account has the potential to qualitatively change theoretical conclusions. The implications of our findings are that well-established approaches in experimental psychology and neuropsychology may not directly translate to the study of individual differences in brain structure, chemistry, and function, and alternative metrics may be required.},

To support our claim, we reanalyzed data from two studies with a new scoring procedure that combines reaction time (RT) and accuracy into a single score. The reanalysis revealed a strong relationship between task switching and WMC that was not present when RT-based switch costs were used as the dependent variable. We discuss the theoretical implications of this finding along with the potential uses and limitations of the scoring procedure we used. More broadly, we emphasize the importance of using measures that incorporate speed and accuracy in other areas of research, particularly in comparisons of subjects differing in cognitive and developmental levels.},

A spike-and-slab prior is a mixture of a null model, the spike, with an effect model, the slab.

The salient difference is that common Bayes factor approaches provide for privileged consideration of theoretically useful parameter values, such as the value corresponding to the null hypothesis, while estimation approaches do not.

	abstract = {[Correction Notice: An Erratum for this article was reported online in Psychological Assessment on Oct 25 2018 (see record 2018-53585-001). In the article “What Item Response Theory Can Tell Us About the Complex Span Tasks,” by Christopher Draheim, Tyler L. Harrison, Susan E. Embretson, and Randall W. Engle (Psychological Assessment, 2018, Vol. 30, No. 1, pp. 116–129, http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/pas0000444), a programming error in the operation span task in Study 2 resulted in set size 8 being administered instead of set size 9. Set sizes 3–7 were administered as intended, but set size 8 was administered twice in each block instead of one instance of set size 8 and one instance of set size 9 per block. As such, all references to set size 9 should be interpreted as an additional administration of set size 8. This error has some minor implications for the results and conclusions of Study 2 whereby it can no longer be confidently asserted that an operation span task with set sizes 8 and 9 added would be any less suitable for higher ability subjects than the rotation and symmetry span tasks. However, the error has no bearing on the argument that the standard administration of the operation span (set sizes 3–7) is lacking and that the addition of larger set sizes to the operation span vastly improves its utility for testing higher ability individuals.] Working memory capacity is an important construct in psychology because of its relationship with many higher-order cognitive abilities and psychopathologies. Working memory capacity is often measured using a type of paradigm known as complex span. Some recent work has focused on shortening the administration time of the complex span tasks, resulting in different versions of these tasks being used (Foster et al., 2015; Oswald, McAbee, Redick, \& Hambrick, 2015). Variations in the complex span tasks, such as the number of set sizes, can lead to varying power to discriminate individuals at different ability levels. Thus, research findings may be inconsistent across populations due to differing appropriateness for the ability levels. The present study uses a combination of item response theory and correlational analyses to better understand the psychometric properties of the operation span, symmetry span, and rotation span. The findings show that the typical administration of these tasks, particularly the operation span, is not suitable for above average ability samples (Study 1; n = 573). When larger set sizes are added to the tasks (Study 2; n = 351), predictive validity and discriminability is improved for all complex span tasks, however the operation span is still inferior to the spatial tasks. The authors make several conclusions about which tasks and set sizes should be used depending on the intended population, and further suggest avoiding the standard-length operation span for average or higher ability populations.

The use of difference scores is a primary factor that leads to many RT measures having demonstrably low reliability, and RT measures in general often do not properly account for speed–accuracy interactions. Both factors jeopardize the validity and interpretability of results based on RT. Here, we evaluate conceptually and empirically how these issues affect individual differences research. Although the empirical evidence we provide are primarily within the domains of attention control and task switching, we highlight examples from various other areas of psychological inquiry. We also discuss many of the statistical and methodological alternatives available to researchers conducting correlational studies.

	abstract = {In modern individual-difference studies, researchers often correlate performance on various tasks to uncover common latent processes. Yet, in some sense, the results have been disappointing as correlations among tasks that seemingly have processes in common are often low. A pressing question then is whether these attenuated correlations reflect statistical considerations, such as a lack of individual variability on tasks, or substantive considerations, such as that inhibition in different tasks is not a unified concept. One problem in addressing this question is that researchers aggregate performance across trials to tally individual-by-task scores. It is tempting to think that aggregation is fine and that everything comes out in the wash. But as shown here, this aggregation may greatly attenuate measures of effect size and correlation. We propose an alternative analysis of task performance that is based on accounting for trial-by-trial variability along with the covariation of individuals’ performance across tasks. The implementation is through common hierarchical models, and this treatment rescues classical concepts of effect size, reliability, and correlation for studying individual differences with experimental tasks. Using recent data from Hedge et al. Behavioral Research Methods, 50(3), 1166–1186, 2018 we show that there is Bayes-factor support for a lack of correlation between the Stroop and flanker task. This support for a lack of correlation indicates a psychologically relevant result—Stroop and flanker inhibition are seemingly unrelated, contradicting unified concepts of inhibition.},

	abstract = {Establishing correlations among common inhibition tasks such as Stroop or flanker tasks has been proven quite difficult despite many attempts.  It remains unknown whether this difficulty occurs because inhibition is a disparate set of phenomena or whether the analytical techiques to uncover a unified inhibition phenomenon fail in real-world contexts.  In this paper, we explore the field-wide inability to assess whether inhibition is unified or disparate. We do so by showing that ordinary methods of correlating performance including those with latent variable models are doomed to fail because of trial noise (or, as it is sometimes called, measurement error).  We then develop hierarchical models that account for variation across trials, variation across individuals, and covariation across individuals and tasks.  These hierarchical models also fail to uncover correlations in typical designs for the same reasons.  While we can charaterize the degree of trial noise, we cannot recover correlations in typical designs that enroll hundreds of people.  We discuss possible improvements to study designs to help uncovering correlations, though we are not sure how feasible they are.},

	abstract = {I present a diffusion model for decision making in continuous report tasks, in which a continuous, circularly distributed, stimulus attribute in working memory is matched to a representation of the attribute in the stimulus display. Memory retrieval is modeled as a 2-dimensional diffusion process with vector-valued drift on a disk, whose bounding circle represents the decision criterion. The direction and magnitude of the drift vector describe the identity of the stimulus and the quality of its representation in memory, respectively. The point at which the diffusion exits the disk determines the reported value of the attribute and the time to exit the disk determines the decision time. Expressions for the joint distribution of decision times and report outcomes are obtained by means of the Girsanov change-of-measure theorem, which allows the properties of the nonzero-drift diffusion process to be characterized as a function of a Euclidian-distance Bessel process. Predicted report precision is equal to the product of the decision criterion and the drift magnitude and follows a von Mises distribution, in agreement with the treatment of precision in the working memory literature. Trial-to-trial variability in criterion and drift rate leads, respectively, to direct and inverse relationships between report accuracy and decision times, in agreement with, and generalizing, the standard diffusion model of 2-choice decisions. The 2-dimensional model provides a process account of working memory precision and its relationship with the diffusion model, and a new way to investigate the properties of working memory, via the distributions of decision times.

There were errors in Table 3 and Table 7 (these transcription errors were limited to descriptive statistics in the Tables and did not affect any inferential statistics). In Table 3, the ARRO-TUT and LETT-TUT variables had incorrect values for Mean [95\% CI], SD, Skew, Kurtosis, and N. In Table 7, the same values (plus Min and Max) were incorrect for the SEM-SART variable. The correct values for these measures are presented in the correction (the values for Min and Max were correct as set in Table 3, but are repeated below for clarity).] A large correlational study took a latent-variable approach to the generality of executive control by testing the individual-differences structure of executive-attention capabilities and assessing their prediction of schizotypy, a multidimensional construct (with negative, positive, disorganized, and paranoid factors) conveying risk for schizophrenia. Although schizophrenia is convincingly linked to executive deficits, the schizotypy literature is equivocal. Subjects completed tasks of working memory capacity (WMC), attention restraint (inhibiting prepotent responses), and attention constraint (focusing visual attention amid distractors), the latter 2 in an effort to fractionate the “inhibition” construct. We also assessed mind-wandering propensity (via in-task thought probes) and coefficient of variation in response times (RT CoV) from several tasks as more novel indices of executive attention. WMC, attention restraint, attention constraint, mind wandering, and RT CoV were correlated but separable constructs, indicating some distinctions among “attention control” abilities; WMC correlated more strongly with attentional restraint than constraint, and mind wandering correlated more strongly with attentional restraint, attentional constraint, and RT CoV than with WMC. Across structural models, no executive construct predicted negative schizotypy and only mind wandering and RT CoV consistently (but modestly) predicted positive, disorganized, and paranoid schizotypy; stalwart executive constructs in the schizophrenia literature—WMC and attention restraint—showed little to no predictive power, beyond restraint’s prediction of paranoia. Either executive deficits are consequences rather than risk factors for schizophrenia, or executive failures barely precede or precipitate diagnosable schizophrenia symptoms.

WMC predicted 51.8\% of variance in insight problem solving and virtually explained its almost isomorphic link to reasoning ability (84.6\% of shared variance). The strong link between WMC and insight pertained generally to most WM tasks and insight problems, was identical for problems solved with and without reported insight, was linear throughout the ability levels, and was not mediated by age, motivation, anxiety, psychoticism, and openness to experience. In contrast to popular views on the sudden and holistic nature of insight, the solving of insight problems results primarily from typical operations carried out by the basic WM mechanisms that are responsible for the maintenance, retrieval, transformation, and control of information in the broad range of intellectual tasks (including fluid reasoning). Little above and beyond WM is unique about insight. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)},

	url = {https://psyarxiv.com/ursbj/},
	abstract = {Individual differences in the ability to control visual attention, often termed ‘attentional control’, has been of particular interest to cognitive researchers. Researchers’ interest in attentional control has led to the development of specific tasks intended to measure this attentional ability. One such task is the anti-saccade task. While attentional performance on the anti-saccade task is typically indexed through the recording of eye movements, increasingly researchers are reporting the use of probe-based methods of indexing attentional performance on the task. Critically, no research has yet determined the convergence of indices of performance yielded by each of these assessment methods, nor compared the reliability of these indices. The purpose of the present study is to examine whether the index of attentional control yielded by a probe-based adaptation of the task converges with the index of attentional control provided by the traditional eye movement task, and whether these alternative approaches have comparable levels of psychometric reliability. The present study will require individuals to complete a probe-based task and an eye movement task, and an index of anti-saccade cost will be computed from each. Correlational analyses will determine the degree to which the anti-saccade cost indices provided by each task converge in their assessment of individual differences in attention control. Further analyses will compare the internal consistency of these two anti-saccade cost indices, and their reliability over time. This manuscript has passed peer review and has been issued an in-principle acceptance (IPA) by the Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology, indicating that the article will be published pending successful completion of the study according to the exact methods and analytic procedures outlined, as well as a defensible and evidence-bound interpretation of the results.},

Experiment 2 demonstrated that manipulating foreperiod duration led to changes in both accuracy and RT for antisaccades but not prosaccades. Furthermore, the change in RT for antisaccades resulted in a lengthening in the tail of the distribution but not a shift in the distribution. Finally, Experiment 3 demonstrated that with sufficient practice performance on antisaccades was equated with performance on prosaccades in terms of both accuracy and RT. An examination of the RT distributions suggested that practice led to parallel changes in both the mean of the distribution and the tail of the antisaccade distribution. These results are interpreted within a two-factor theory of attention control that suggests that performance on antisaccades is driven by both competition resolution and goal-maintenance abilities.},

Here we contrast target discrimination performance following either a prosaccade or antisaccade in the spatial cueing paradigm. Our findings suggest that the level of activation of the reflexive oculomotor system determines the dynamics of the inhibitory effect, wherein an effect nearer to the input end of processing is observed when the reflexive oculomotor system is actively suppressed, and an effect nearer to the output end of processing is observed when the reflexive oculomotor system is actively engaged. These effects interact differently with the Simon effect—providing converging evidence that they are dissociable inhibitory phenomena.},

	abstract = {Several current models hold that frontoparietal areas exert cognitive control by biasing task-relevant processing in other brain areas. Previous event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have compared prosaccades and antisaccades, which require subjects to look toward or away from a flashed peripheral stimulus, respectively. These studies found greater activation for antisaccades in frontal and parietal regions at the ends of long (≥6 s) preparatory periods preceding peripheral stimulus presentation. Event-related fMRI studies using short preparatory periods (≤4 s) have not found such activation differences except in the frontal eye field. Here, we identified activation differences associated with short (1-s) preparatory periods by interleaving half trials among regular whole trials in a rapid fMRI design. On whole trials, a colored fixation dot instructed human subjects to make either a prosaccade toward or an antisaccade away from a peripheral visual stimulus. Half trials included only the instruction and not peripheral stimulus presentation or saccade generation. Nonetheless, half trials evoked stronger activation on antisaccades than on prosaccades in the frontal eye field (FEF), supplementary eye field (SEF), left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), intraparietal sulcus (IPS), and precuneus. Greater antisaccade response-related activation was found in FEF, SEF, IPS, and precuneus but not in DLPFC or ACC. These results demonstrate greater preparatory activation for antisaccades versus prosaccades in frontoparietal areas and suggest that prefrontal cortex and anterior cingulate cortex are more involved in presetting the saccade network for the antisaccade task than generating the actual antisaccade response.},

Experiments 1–5 and 7 examined individual differences in aspects of goal management processes occurring during the preparatory delay of the antisaccade task. WMC tended to interact with delay interval suggesting that high WMC individuals better prepared for the upcoming trial by activating the task goal to a higher level than low WMC individuals (although these effects were generally small). Experiments 3a, 4, and 7 further demonstrated that individual differences in the consistency of attention (i.e., lapses of attention) were partially important for the relation between WMC and antisaccade performance. Experiment 5 demonstrated that knowledge of the likelihood of target location increased overall performance, but did not interact with WMC. Experiment 6 manipulated stimulus onset asynchrony and suggested that speed factors are also likely important for the relation between WMC and antisaccade performance. Finally, structural equation models in Experiment 7 suggested that lapses of attention and speed factors partially accounted for the relation between WMC and antisaccade, but WMC still accounted for unique variance in antisaccade. Collectively, the results suggest that multiple factors (goal activation, consistency of attention, and speed factors) contribute to the relation between variation in WMC and performance on the antisaccade task.},

This task requires subjects to suppress a reflexive prosaccade to a flashed visual stimulus and instead to generate a voluntary saccade to the opposite side. This article reviews what is currently known about the neural structures and processes which are involved in the performance of this task. Current data show that a variety of brain lesions, neurological diseases and psychiatric disorders result in errors, i.e. prosaccades towards the stimulus, in this task. Brain imaging studies have shown that a widely distributed cortical and subcortical network is active during the generation of antisaccades. These findings are discussed and the potential of the antisaccade task for diagnostic purposes is evaluated.},

The secondary saccades are large, corrective, of shorter than primary latency, and are not based on retinal feedback. Thus, the human saccadic system is optimized for, but not restricted to, foveation. The highly idiosyncratic “anti” latency data can be normalized by reference to the Wheeless 2-step paradigm.

	abstract = {The anti-saccade task, in which subjects are required to make a saccadic eye movement away from a target, rather than towards it, is a useful task for investigating the voluntary and flexible control of movement. Anti-saccades have a longer latency than pro-saccades and subjects are more likely to make errors on anti-saccade trials. These errors usually consist of a rapid saccade to the target, which is often corrected within a short latency by a second saccade away from the target. Two processes are needed for the anti-saccade task: suppression of the automatic pro-saccade, and inversion of the stimulus vector into the correct saccade vector.Monkeys and humans perform similarly on this task. In electrophysiological studies of monkeys doing the anti-saccade task, saccade neurons in the superior colliculus (SC) and frontal eye fields (FEF) seem to be inhibited before the target appears, to suppress the automatic pro-saccade. This is proposed to prevent activity in these neurons from crossing a threshold that would allow a saccade to be initiated. The suppression could arise from several sources, including other neurons in the FEF and SC, the supplementary eye fields, the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and the substantia nigra pars reticulata.The generation of the anti-saccade requires vector inversion and a build-up of activity in a different set of saccade neurons. Monkey electrophysiology studies indicate that vector inversion involves the lateral intraparietal area and/or the FEF.In humans, functional imaging and event-related potential (ERP) studies have been used to study the anti-saccade task. These studies have identified differences in brain activity between pro-saccades and anti-saccades that are consistent with data from electrophysiological studies in monkeys.Young children struggle to perform the anti-saccade task, apparently because they have difficulty in suppressing the automatic pro-saccade. This might relate to the protracted maturation of the frontal lobes, which have been proposed to mediate top-down inhibition of saccade neurons. Patients with lesions of the DLPFC have a similar deficit in performance. By contrast, lesions of the FEF impair the ability of patients to generate the anti-saccade.A number of clinical conditions affect performance on the anti-saccade task. Patients with schizophrenia show increased error rates and prolonged reaction times. Patients with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder struggle to suppress the automatic pro-saccade but do not show delays in reaction times, whereas those with Parkinson's disease have significantly increased reaction times and also an increased error rate. Tourette's syndrome causes an increase in reaction time with no increase in error rate, possibly because these patients generate increased top-down inhibition as a consequence of adapting to the disorder. All of these findings can be interpreted in the context of an 'accumulator model' of saccade generation.},

Several tasks have been proposed to examine cognitive control, including Stroop, Eriksen-Flanker, and the Multi-source interference task. Because these tasks have been studied independently, it remains unclear whether the neural signatures of cognitive control reflect abstract control mechanisms or specific combinations of sensory and behavioral aspects of each task. To address this question, here we recorded invasive neurophysiological signals from 16 subjects and directly compared the three tasks against each other. Neural activity patterns in the theta and high-gamma frequency bands differed between incongruent and congruent conditions, revealing strong modulation by conflicting task demands. These neural signals were specific to each task, generalizing within a task but not across tasks. These results highlight the complex interplay between sensory inputs, motor outputs, and task demands and argue against a universal and abstract representation of conflict.},

A review of other experiments in semantic memory shows that many of them are likewise suspect.

Other evaluations are done at the single-subject level, and so fail to benefit from the reduction of noise that data averaging or aggregation potentially provides. To overcome these weaknesses, we have developed a general approach to modeling individual differences using families of cognitive models in which different groups of subjects are identified as having different psychological behavior. Separate models with separate parameterizations are applied to each group of subjects, and Bayesian model selection is used to determine the appropriate number of groups. We evaluate this individual differences approach in a simulation study and show that it is superior in terms of the key modeling goals of prediction and understanding. We also provide two practical demonstrations of the approach, one using the ALCOVE model of category learning with data from four previously analyzed category learning experiments, the other using multidimensional scaling representational models with previously analyzed similarity data for colors. In both demonstrations, meaningful individual differences are found and the psychological models are able to account for this variation through interpretable differences in parameterization. The results highlight the potential of extending cognitive models to consider individual differences.},

This parsimonious model accumulates noisy pieces of evidence toward a decision bound to explain the accuracy and reaction times of subjects. Recently, Bayesian models have been proposed to explain how the brain extracts information from noisy input as typically presented in perceptual decision making tasks. It has long been known that the drift-diffusion model is tightly linked with such functional Bayesian models but the precise relationship of the two mechanisms was never made explicit. Using a Bayesian model, we derived the equations which relate parameter values between these models. In practice we show that this equivalence is useful when fitting multi-subject data. We further show that the Bayesian model suggests different decision variables which all predict equal responses and discuss how these may be discriminated based on neural correlates of accumulated evidence. In addition, we discuss extensions to the Bayesian model which would be difficult to derive for the drift-diffusion model. We suggest that these and other extensions may be highly useful for deriving new experiments which test novel hypotheses.},

	abstract = {The ability to regulate behavior in service of long-term goals is a widely studied psychological construct known as self-regulation. This wide interest is in part due to the putative relations between self-regulation and a range of real-world behaviors. Self-regulation is generally viewed as a trait, and individual differences are quantified using a diverse set of measures, including self-report surveys and behavioral tasks. Accurate characterization of individual differences requires measurement reliability, a property frequently characterized in self-report surveys, but rarely assessed in behavioral tasks. We remedy this gap by (
              i
              ) providing a comprehensive literature review on an extensive set of self-regulation measures and (
              ii
              ) empirically evaluating test–retest reliability of this battery in a new sample. We find that dependent variables (DVs) from self-report surveys of self-regulation have high test–retest reliability, while DVs derived from behavioral tasks do not. This holds both in the literature and in our sample, although the test–retest reliability estimates in the literature are highly variable. We confirm that this is due to differences in between-subject variability. We also compare different types of task DVs (e.g., model parameters vs. raw response times) in their suitability as individual difference DVs, finding that certain model parameters are as stable as raw DVs. Our results provide greater psychometric footing for the study of self-regulation and provide guidance for future studies of individual differences in this domain.},

	abstract = {Many ecological systems have chaotic or near-chaotic dynamics. In such cases, it is difficult to test whether the data fit particular models, because the noise makes statistical comparison with the model impossible. Simon Wood has now devised a statistical method for making such inferences, based on extracting phase-insensitive summary statistics from the raw data and comparing to data that are simulated from the model. The method is demonstrated by an application to a well-known problem: the nature of the cycles in John Nicholson's classic ecological experiments on population size in the sheep blowfly Lucilia cuprina.},

	abstract = {Stochastic diffusion models (Ratcliff, 1978) can be used to analyze response time data from binary decision tasks. They provide detailed information about cognitive processes underlying the performance in such tasks. Most importantly, different parameters are estimated from the response time distributions of correct responses and errors that map (1) the speed of information uptake, (2) the amount of information used to make a decision, (3) possible decision biases, and (4) the duration of nondecisional processes. Although this kind of model can be applied to many experimental paradigms and provides much more insight than the analysis of mean response times can, it is still rarely used in cognitive psychology. In the present paper, we provide comprehensive information on the theory of the diffusion model, as well as on practical issues that have to be considered for implementing the model.},

Sets of simulated data were generated with known parameter values, and from fits of the model, we found that the maximum likelihood method was better than the chi-square and weighted least squares methods by criteria of bias in the parameters relative to the parameter values used to generate the data and standard deviations in the parameter estimates. The standard deviations in the parameter values can be used as measures of the variability in parameter estimates from fits to experimental data. We introduced contaminant reaction times and variability into the other components of processing besides the decision process and found that the maximum likelihood and chi-square methods failed, sometimes dramatically. But the weighted least squares method was robust to these two factors. We then present results from modifications of the maximum likelihood and chi-square methods, in which these factors are explicitly modeled, and show that the parameter values of the diffusion model are recovered well. We argue that explicit modeling is an important method for addressing contaminants and variability in nondecision processes and that it can be applied in any theoretical approach to modeling reaction time.},

These accumulators have bounds, and the first accumulator to reach its bound determines the response time and response choice. The times at which accumulator reaches its bound is assumed to be lognormally distributed, hence the model is race or minima process among lognormal variables. A key property of the model is that it is relatively straightforward to place a wide variety of models on the logarithm of these finishing times including linear models, structural equation models, autoregressive models, growth-curve models, etc. Consequently, the model has excellent statistical and psychometric properties and can be used in a wide range of contexts, from laboratory experiments to high-stakes testing, to assess performance.

The diffusion model can explain all these aspects of the data for the four experiments we present. The model correctly accounts for error response times, something previous models have failed to do.

The probe item evokes the search set on the basis of probe–memory item relatedness, just as a ringing tuning fork evokes sympathetic vibrations in other tuning forks. Evidence is accumulated in parallel from each probe–memory item comparison, and each comparison is modeled by a continuous random walk process. In item recognition, the decision process is self-terminating on matching comparisons and exhaustive on nonmatching comparisons. The mathematical model produces predictions about accuracy, mean reaction time, error latency, and reaction time distributions that are in good accord with data from 2 experiments conducted with 6 undergraduates. The theory is applied to 4 item recognition paradigms (Sternberg, prememorized list, study–test, and continuous) and to speed–accuracy paradigms; results are found to provide a basis for comparison of these paradigms. It is noted that neural network models can be interfaced to the retrieval theory with little difficulty and that semantic memory models may benefit from such a retrieval scheme.

These techniques lead to a modeling framework that is highly flexible and easy to work with. Among the many novel models this statistical framework provides are a multilevel diffusion model, regression diffusion models, and a large family of explanatory diffusion models.

The most popular style of accumulator model is the diffusion model (Ratcliff Psychological Review, 85, 59–108, 1978), which has been shown to account for data from a wide range of paradigms, including perceptual discrimination, letter identification, lexical decision, recognition memory, and signal detection. Since its original inception, the model has become increasingly complex in order to account for subtle, but reliable, data patterns. The additional complexity of the diffusion model renders it a tool that is only for experts. In response, Wagenmakers et al. (Psychonomic Bulletin \& Review, 14, 3–22, 2007) proposed that researchers could use a more basic version of the diffusion model, the EZ diffusion. Here, we simulate experimental effects on data generated from the full diffusion model and compare the power of the full diffusion model and EZ diffusion to detect those effects. We show that the EZ diffusion model, by virtue of its relative simplicity, will be sometimes better able to detect experimental effects than the data–generating full diffusion model.},

	abstract = {Continuous-outcome decisions, in which responses are made on continuous scales, are increasingly used to study perception and memory for stimulus attributes like color, orientation, and motion. This interest has led to the development of models of continuous-outcome decision processes like the circular diffusion model that predict joint distributions of decision outcomes and response times (RTs). We use the circular diffusion model and a new spherical generalization of it to model performance in a continuous-outcome version of the random-dot motion task. The task is a benchmark test of decision models because it yields bimodal distributions of decision outcomes: In addition to a peak or mode in the true direction of motion, there is a secondary, antipodal, mode at 180° to the true direction. Models like the circular diffusion model, in which evidence is accumulated by a single process, are thought to be unable to predict bimodality. We compared diffusion models for the continuous motion task in which evidence is accumulated in either a two-dimensional (2D) or a three-dimensional (3D) representational space. We found that performance was well described by a spherical (3D) diffusion model in which the drift rate encodes perceived motion direction and strength and the points on the bounding sphere representing the decision criterion are projected onto a 2D circle to make a response. A model with an antipodal component of drift rate and drift-rate variability successfully predicted bimodal distributions of decision outcomes and the joint distributions of decision outcomes and RT for individual participants.

In Experiment 1, 32 adults performed alternating blocks of global or local identification of hierarchical letter stimuli in which the global and local letters were congruent, incongruent, or neutral, and were presented at either a short (17ms) or long (100ms) exposure duration. A global advantage was demonstrated at both durations. In the local-directed task, interference on incongruent, relative to neutral, trials was observed at both exposure durations, but facilitation on congruent trials, relative to neutral trials, was present only when stimuli were presented at the long exposure duration. In Experiment 2, global or local identification was performed by another group of 24 adults at either a long or short exposure duration, and also under conditions of full attention (FA) or dual-task (DT) conditions with a digit-monitoring task. Under FA, we again found significant interference at both exposure durations, but facilitation only at the long exposure duration. Under DT conditions, the pattern of facilitation and interference at the short duration remained unchanged. At the long duration, however, dual-tasking eliminated interference in the RT but not error data, while facilitation was present in both sets of data. Results are in line with a perceptual account of the global advantage, and suggest that facilitation requires consciously-mediated processes, whereas interference does not.},

In Experiment 3 subjects were presented with large characters made out of small ones, and they had to recognize either just the large characters or just the small ones. Whereas the identity of the small characters had no effect on recognition of the large ones, global cues which conflicted with the local ones did inhibit the responses to the local level. In Experiment 4 subjects were asked to judge whether pairs of simple patterns of geometrical forms which were presented for a brief duration were the same or different. The patterns within a pair could differ either at the global or at the local level. It was found that global differences were detected more often than local differences.},

	abstract = {We propose a linear ballistic accumulator (LBA) model of decision making and reaction time. The LBA is simpler than other models of choice response time, with independent accumulators that race towards a common response threshold. Activity in the accumulators increases in a linear and deterministic manner. The simplicity of the model allows complete analytic solutions for choices between any number of alternatives. These solutions (and freely-available computer code) make the model easy to apply to both binary and multiple choice situations. Using data from five previously published experiments, we demonstrate that the LBA model successfully accommodates empirical phenomena from binary and multiple choice tasks that have proven difficult for other theoretical accounts. Our results are encouraging in a field beset by the tradeoff between complexity and completeness.},

In the first two experiments subjects were asked to respond to an auditorily presented name of a letter while looking at a visual stimulus that consisted of a large character (the global level) made out of small characters (the local level). The subjects' auditory discrimination responses were subject to interference only by the global level and not by the local one. In Experiment 3 subjects were presented with large characters made out of small ones, and they had to recognize either just the large characters or just the small ones. Whereas the identity of the small characters had no effect on recognition of the large ones, global cues which conflicted with the local ones did inhibit the responses to the local level. In Experiment 4 subjects were asked to judge whether pairs of simple patterns of geometrical forms which were presented for a brief duration were the same or different. The patterns within a pair could differ either at the global or at the local level. It was found that global differences were detected more often than local differences.},

	abstract = {In cognitive research, speed and accuracy are two important aspects of performance. When analyzed separately, these performance variables sometimes lead to contradictory conclusions about the effect of a manipulation. To avoid such conflicts, several measures that integrate speed and accuracy have been proposed, but the added value of using such measures remains unclear. The present paper compares the relative utility of seven integrated performance measures, namely four variations on a binning procedure that weights response times of correct and incorrect trials differently, and three measures that combine averaged speed and accuracy scores. The properties of these integrated measures were explored in three simulation studies. The first study compared three binning measures and showed that one measure failed to grasp the performance difference between two conditions. The second study showed that the sampling distributions of the measures were symmetric, except for a strong skewness on the rate correct score. The third study varied the trade-off and the effect sizes of speed and accuracy in four different combinations of size and direction of speed and accuracy effects. These studies highlighted some further shortcomings of the binning measures. The combination measures performed well, but linear integration of speed and accuracy and rate correct score were most efficient in detecting effects and accounting for a larger proportion of the variance. The paper concludes that these combination measures are useful provided that the speed and accuracy data are also inspected.},

	abstract = {Previous research has shown that individuals with greater cognitive abilities display a greater speed of higher-order cognitive processing. These results suggest that speeded neural information processing may facilitate evidence accumulation during decision making and memory updating and thus yield advantages in general cognitive abilities. We used a hierarchical Bayesian cognitive modeling approach to test the hypothesis that individual differences in the velocity of evidence accumulation mediate the relationship between neural processing speed and cognitive abilities. We found that a higher neural speed predicted both the velocity of evidence accumulation across behavioral tasks and cognitive ability test scores. However, only a negligible part of the association between neural processing speed and cognitive abilities was mediated by individual differences in the velocity of evidence accumulation. The model demonstrated impressive forecasting abilities by predicting 36\% of individual variation in cognitive ability test scores in an entirely new sample solely based on their electrophysiological and behavioral data. Our results suggest that individual differences in neural processing speed might affect a plethora of higher-order cognitive processes, that only in concert explain the large association between neural processing speed and cognitive abilities, instead of the effect being entirely explained by differences in evidence accumulation speeds.},

Our focus is on the receiver side: what makes an individual feel loved and how felt love is defined through daily interactions. Our aim is to explore everyday life scenarios in which people might experience love, and to consider people’s converging and diverging judgments about which scenarios indicate felt love. We apply a cognitive psychometric approach to quantify a receiver’s ability to detect, understand, and know that they are loved. Through crowd-sourcing, we surveyed lay participants about whether various scenarios were indicators of felt love. We thus quantify these responses to make inference about consensus judgments of felt love, measure individual levels of agreement with consensus, and assess individual response styles. More specifically, we (1) derive consensus judgments on felt love; (2) describe its characteristics in qualitative and quantitative terms, (3) explore individual differences in both (a) participant agreement with consensus, and (b) participant judgment when uncertain about shared knowledge, and (4) test whether individual differences can be meaningfully linked to explanatory variables. Results indicate that people converge towards a shared cognitive model of felt love. Conversely, respondents showed heterogeneity in knowledge of consensus, and in dealing with uncertainty. We found that, when facing uncertainty, female respondents and people in relationships more frequently judge scenarios as indicators of felt love. Moreover, respondents from smaller households tend to know more about consensus judgments of felt love, while respondents from larger households are more willing to guess when unsure of consensus.},

Failures to replicate the bilingual advantage have been attributed to methodological factors such as comparing dichotomous groups and measuring cognitive abilities separately with single tasks. Therefore, the authors evaluated the 4 most prominent hypotheses of bilingual advantages for inhibitory control, conflict monitoring, shifting, and general cognitive performance by assessing bilingualism on 3 continuous dimensions (age of acquisition, proficiency, and usage) in a sample of 118 young adults and relating it to 9 cognitive abilities each measured by multiple tasks. Linear mixed-effects models accounting for multiple sources of variance simultaneously and controlling for parents’ education as an index of socioeconomic status revealed no evidence for any of the 4 hypotheses. Hence, the authors’ results suggest that bilingual benefits are not as broad and as robust as has been previously claimed. Instead, earlier effects were possibly due to task-specific effects in selective and often small samples. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)},

Simon effects across a variety of conditions, however, are largest for fast responses but decrease, and even reverse, as responses slow. We show in three experiments that these diverging patterns hold within participants and even when the stimulus materials are identical across the tasks. These stable differences in time course serve as bedrock phenomena for building and testing theories of cognitive control and inhibition.

The diffusion model can explain all these aspects of the data for the four experiments we present. The model correctly accounts for error response times, something previous models have failed to do.

JAGS is intended to be modular and extensible, and modules written in the way laid out here can be loaded at runtime as needed and do not interfere with regular JAGS functionality when not loaded. Writing custom extensions requires knowledge of C++, but installing a new module can be highly automatic, depending on the operating system. As a basic example, we implement a Bernoulli distribution in JAGS. We further present our implementation of the Wiener diffusion first-passage time distribution, which is freely available at https://sourceforge.net/projects/jags-wiener/.},

	abstract = {The functions of the rostrolateral prefrontal cortex (RLPFC) have recently become the target of multiple theories and empirical investigations. This region can be loosely defined as the lateral portion of Brodmann area (BA) 10. One of the challenges in testing theories about RLPFC functions is the difficulty in defining its boundaries when formulating predictions for its recruitment. Here we present a procedure that goes beyond the currently available anatomical definitions to attempt a functional localization of RLPFC. A combination of functional and anatomical criteria was employed, consistent with other localizer procedures. Functional localization was performed by comparing a relational condition involving relational matching to a control condition involving feature matching. It was expected that within an anatomically defined BA10 region, this procedure would produce functional activations in the lateral but not the medial subregions. The task was administered in the course of a single 13-min fMRI session. Results showed remarkable consistency, with all subjects activating RLPFC and activations consistently localized in the lateral part of BA10. These results demonstrate the practical feasibility of localizing RLPFC using a short procedure and a combination of functional and anatomical criteria. Such localization presents with a number of potential advantages for testing theories of RLPFC functions, including improved anatomical precision of experimental predictions, as well as the possibility of reduction in the rate of false-negative findings across studies. In addition, the results provide further support for the previously proposed functional dissociation between lateral and medial BA10.},

"The well-known virtue of the experimental method is that it brings situational variables under tight control… . The correlation method, for its part, can study what man has not learned to control or can never hope to control… . A true federation of the disciplines is required. Kept independent, they can give only wrong answers or no answers at all regarding certain important problems… . Correlational psychology studies only variance among organisms; experimental psychology studies only variance among treatments.

In the cognitive neurosciences, the diffusion decision model has recently been adopted as a quantitative tool to study the neural basis of decision making under time pressure. We present a selective overview of several recent applications and extensions of the diffusion decision model in the cognitive neurosciences.},

Given its conceptual simplicity, its grounding in fundamental Bayesian principles and its very few free parameters, it is being increasingly adopted for a wider range of choice tasks, helping us to understand the underlying neural mechanisms, and in applying this to clinical disorders. Here, we provide a thorough discussion of the history behind this model, and how it can be applied to more complex decisions, including anti-saccades, Go-NoGo, countermanding and other situations where newly-arriving information means that ongoing decisions must be modified. The neuroscience of decision-making is progressing rapidly, and we anticipate that wider understanding and application of this model will help simplify the interpretation of increasingly advanced decision behaviour both in the laboratory and clinic.},

Galton's research centered on measuring individual differences on a variety of physical, personality, and cognitive traits. During the first half of the 20th century, the information sciences developed many concepts that cognitive psychologists could use as the basis for constructing formal models of human cognition. The Multinomial Processing Tree Models (MPT) class includes cognitive models for standard paradigms in human memory, attention, categorization, choice, and social psychology. Cultural Consensus Theory (CCT) consists of a collection of formal cognitive response models and statistical inference methods for analyzing the responses of the group members to questions about their shared knowledge.},

To introduce this special issue, we discuss four of the most important potential hierarchical Bayesian contributions. The first involves the development of more complete theories, including accounting for variation coming from sources like individual differences in cognition. The second involves the capability to account for observed behavior in terms of the combination of multiple different cognitive processes. The third involves using a few key psychological variables to explain behavior on a wide range of cognitive tasks. The fourth involves the conceptual unification and integration of disparate cognitive models. For all of these potential contributions, we outline an appropriate general hierarchical Bayesian modeling structure. We also highlight current models that already use the hierarchical Bayesian approach, as well as identifying research areas that could benefit from its adoption.},

	abstract = {There is growing interest in diffusion models to represent the cognitive and neural processes of speeded decision making. Sequential-sampling models like the diffusion model have a long history in psychology. They view decision making as a process of noisy accumulation of evidence from a stimulus. The standard model assumes that evidence accumulates at a constant rate during the second or two it takes to make a decision. This process can be linked to the behaviors of populations of neurons and to theories of optimality. Diffusion models have been used successfully in a range of cognitive tasks and as psychometric tools in clinical research to examine individual differences. In this review, we relate the models to both earlier and more recent research in psychology.},

By applying linear mixed effects modeling (Pinheiro \& Bates, 2000), we call attention to the potential lack of power of the by-subject and by-item analyses, which in this case study fail to reveal the coexistence of a facilitatory family size effect and an inhibitory family frequency effect in visual and auditory lexical processing.},

Nevertheless, these same investigators do not hesitate to conclude that their findings are true for language in general. In so doing, it is argued, they are committing the language-as-fixed-effect fallacy, which can lead to serious error. The problem is illustrated for one well-known series of studies in semantic memory. With the appropriate statistics these studies are shown to provide no reliable evidence for most of the main conclusions drawn from them. A review of other experiments in semantic memory shows that many of them are likewise suspect. It is demonstrated how this fallacy can be avoided by doing the right statistics, selecting the appropriate design, and sampling by systematic procedures, or, alternatively, by proceeding according to the so-called method of single cases.},

Three experiments are used to illustrate experimental manipulations of three components: stimulus difficulty affects the quality of information on which a decision is based; instructions emphasizing either speed or accuracy affect the criterial amounts of information that a subject requires before initiating a response; and the relative proportions of the two stimuli affect biases in drift rate and starting point. The experiments also illustrate the strong constraints that ensure the model is empirically testable and potentially falsifiable. The broad range of applications of the model is also reviewed, including research in the domains of aging and neurophysiology.},

We present and demonstrate a fully Bayesian implementation and extension of the CDDM. This development allows researchers to apply the CDDM to data from complex experiments and draw conclusions about targeted hypotheses. The Bayesian implementation relies on a custom JAGS module. We describe the module and demonstrate its adequacy through a simulation study. We then illustrate the advantages of the implementation by revisiting data from a continuous orientation judgment task. We develop a graphical model for the analysis that is based on the CDDM but extends it with hierarchical and latent-mixture structures. We then demonstrate how these extensions are used to accommodate the design of the experiment and to implement psychological assumptions about individual differences, the difficulty of different stimulus conditions, and the impact of cues on decision making. Finally, we demonstrate how the computational Bayesian inference enabled by JAGS allows these assumptions to be tested and addresses psychological research questions about people’s decision making.},

	abstract = {The use of quantile functions of probability distributions whose cumulative distribution is intractable is often limited in Monte Carlo simulation, modeling, and random number generation. Gamma distribution is one of such distributions, and that has placed limitations on the use of gamma distribution in modeling fading channels and systems described by the gamma distribution. This is due to the inability to ﬁnd a suitable closed-form expression for the inverse cumulative distribution function, commonly known as the quantile function (QF). This paper adopted the Quantile mechanics approach to transform the probability density function of the gamma distribution to second-order nonlinear ordinary differential equations (ODEs) whose solution leads to quantile approximation. Closed-form expressions, although complex of the QF, were obtained from the solution of the ODEs for degrees of freedom from one to ﬁve. The cases where the degree of freedom is not an integer were obtained, which yielded values closed to the R software values via Monte Carlo simulation. This paper provides an alternative for simulating gamma random variables when the degree of freedom is not an integer. The results obtained are fast, computationally efﬁcient and compare favorably with the machine (R software) values using absolute error and Kullback–Leibler divergence as performance metrics.},

An alternative approach is to use decision-making tasks that involve risk and uncertainty, and apply cognitive models of task behavior to infer parameters that measure people’s risk propensity. We report the results of a within-participants experiment that used three questionnaires and four decision-making tasks. The questionnaires are the Risk Propensity Scale, the Risk Taking Index, and the Domain Specific Risk Taking Scale. The decision-making tasks are the Balloon Analogue Risk Task, the preferential choice gambling task, the optimal stopping problem, and the bandit problem. We analyze the relationships between the risk measures and cognitive parameters using Bayesian inferences about the patterns of correlation, and using a novel cognitive latent variable modeling approach. The results show that people’s risk propensity is generally consistent within different conditions for each of the decision-making tasks. There is, however, little evidence that the way people manage risk generalizes across the tasks, or that it corresponds to the questionnaire measures.},

	doi = {10.1037/xhp0000606},
	abstract = {Despite the prevalence of real-world and laboratory tasks where people select among many options, cognitive models have traditionally focused on choices among small sets of alternatives. This has resulted in theoretical and empirical gaps in understanding the decision processes that go into selections among many alternatives or responses that fall along a continuum. This paper addresses these issues by modeling decisions in a perceptual study where participants produce continuous orientation judgments. The experiments showed that manipulations of stimulus difficulty and time pressure have parallel effects to binary choice, with greater stimulus difficulty yielding slower and less accurate responses and time pressure resulting in faster responses at the expense of accuracy. These effects were well accounted for by the circular diffusion model developed by Smith (2016), with drift magnitude parameters shifting with difficulty and threshold parameters shifting with time pressure. However, a manipulation of bias using a predecision cue resulted in bimodal distributions of responses that cannot be explained by the model in its original formulation. To account for this result, I developed a theory of bias based on split attention and racing 2D diffusion processes. This model suggests that responses are determined by both cue-driven and stimulus-driven evidence accumulation processes, such that the winning process determines responses and response times (RTs). As a result, it predicts critical features of responses and response times in the conditions with predecision cues, including bimodal distributions of responses and the longer RTs observed when there was a discrepancy between cue and stimulus orientations.

	abstract = {Previous research has characterized source retrieval as a thresholded process, which fails on a proportion of trials and leads to guessing, as opposed to a continuous process, in which response precision varies across trials but is never zero. The thresholded view of source retrieval is largely based on the observation of heavy tailed distributions of response errors, thought to reflect a large proportion of “memoryless” trials. In this study, we investigate whether these errors might instead reflect systematic intrusions from other list items which can mimic source guessing. Using the circular diffusion model of decision making, which accounts for both response errors and RTs we found that intrusions account for some, but not all, errors in a continuous-report source memory task. We found that intrusion errors were more likely to come from items studied in nearby locations and times, and were well-described by a spatiotemporal gradient model, but not from semantically or perceptually similar cues. Our findings support a thresholded view of source retrieval but suggest that previous work has overestimated the proportion of guesses which have been conflated with intrusions.},

	abstract = {A circular analogue of the diffusion model adapted for continuous response tasks is applied to a continuous-outcome source memory task. In contrast to existing models of source retrieval that attribute all of the variability in responding to memory, the circular diffusion model decomposes noise into variability arising from memory and from decision processes. We compared three models: (1) a single diffusion process with trial-to-trial variability in drift rate, (2) a mixture of two diffusion processes, one with positive drift that does not vary from trial-to-trial, and a second zero-drift process that represents discrete guessing, and (3) a hybrid model that mixed positive and zero-drift processes with trial-to-trial variability in the positive drift process. Comparison of model fits to joint response error and response-time (RT) data suggest that a memory strength threshold under which no information is retrieved appears to underlie responding in a continuous-report source memory task. Additionally, we also conditioned participants’ source responding on their confidence in an old/new recognition task, ruling out the possibility that participant guessing was only due to unrecognized items. Overall, our findings support an all-or-none or some-or none view of source memory retrieval and pose a challenge to continuous models of source memory.},

	abstract = {Formal models in psychology are used to make theoretical ideas precise and allow them to be evaluated quantitatively against data. We focus on one important—but under-used and incorrectly maligned—method for building theoretical assumptions into formal models, offered by the Bayesian statistical approach. This method involves capturing theoretical assumptions about the psychological variables in models by placing informative prior distributions on the parameters representing those variables. We demonstrate this approach of casting basic theoretical assumptions in an informative prior by considering a case study that involves the generalized context model (GCM) of category learning. We capture existing theorizing about the optimal allocation of attention in an informative prior distribution to yield a model that is higher in psychological content and lower in complexity than the standard implementation. We also highlight that formalizing psychological theory within an informative prior distribution allows standard Bayesian model selection methods to be applied without concerns about the sensitivity of results to the prior. We then use Bayesian model selection to test the theoretical assumptions about optimal allocation formalized in the prior. We argue that the general approach of using psychological theory to guide the specification of informative prior distributions is widely applicable and should be routinely used in psychological modeling.},

	abstract = {The circular diffusion model is extended to provide a theory of the speed and accuracy of continuous outcome color decisions and used to characterize eye-movement decisions about the hues of noisy color patches in an isoluminant, equidiscriminability color space. Heavy-tailed distributions of decision outcomes were found with high levels of chromatic noise, similar to those found in visual working memory studies with high memory loads. Decision times were longer for less accurate decisions, in agreement with the slow error property typically found in difficult 2-choice tasks. Decision times were shorter, and responses were more accurate in parts of the space corresponding to nameable color categories, although the number and locations of the categories varied among participants. We show that these findings can be predicted by a theory of across-trial variability in the quality of the evidence entering the decision process, represented mathematically by the drift rate of the diffusion process. The heavy-tailed distributions of decision outcomes and the slow-error pattern can be predicted by either of 2 models of drift rate. One model is based on encoding failures and the other is based on a nonlinear transformation of the stimulus space. Both models predict highly inaccurate stimulus representations on some trials, leading to heavy-tailed distributions and slow errors. The color-category effects were successfully modeled as stimulus biases in a similarity-choice framework, in which the drift rate is the vector sum of the encoded metric and categorical representations of the stimulus.

The Girsanov change-of-measure theorem applied to the first-passage time distribution for the Euclidean distance Bessel process yields an explicit expression for the joint distribution of decision outcomes and decision times for the model. A problem with the expression for the joint distribution obtained in this way is that the change-of-measure calculation magnifies numerical noise in the series expression for the Bessel process, which can make the expression unstable at small times when the drift rate or decision criterion is large. We introduce a new method that uses an asymptotic approximation to characterize the Bessel process at short times and the series expression for the large times. The resulting expressions are stable across all parts of the parameter space likely to be of interest in experiments, which greatly simplifies the task of fitting the model to data. The new method applies to the spherical and hyperspherical generalizations of the model and to versions of it in which the drift rates are normally distributed across trials with independent or correlated components.},

Using a specific class of models called random walk models, I review evidence showing that the empirical relations taken as support for global age-related changes are consistent with a number of possible age effects on information processing. In addition, I demonstrate that these models can be used to account for age differences within the context of individual experiments and such modelling has important implications for the interpretation of age differences in performance.},

	abstract = {In recent years, the probing of cognitive processes underpinning choice in continuous-outcome space paradigms has attracted the attention of modeling researchers to provide a dynamic decision theory of speed and accuracy. One of the most important of these continuous models is the circular diffusion model (CDM, Smith, 2016, Psychological Review) which assumes a noisy accumulation process, described mathematically as a stochastic two-dimensional Wiener process on the interior of a disk. Despite the significant advantages of this powerful model, however, due to its mathematical complexity, very few researchers have used the CDM in their work. Here, we propose a simple and easy-to-use method for estimating the CDM parameters and fitting the model on continuous scale data by simple formulas that can be computed easily and needs neither theoretical knowledge of model fitting nor much programming skills. Despite being simple and easy, we show that the method surprisingly works with precision near the maximum likelihood estimation method. Also, we introduce a robust version of the method that is still simple but is almost immune to the contaminant responses. Finally, the actual use of the method for experimental data is given with an example of using the method, alongside estimation of guess probability in data. It is hoped that this simple approach introduced here can, on the one hand, take a step towards bridging the gap between theory and experimental data falling along a continuum, on the other hand, can encourage cognitive psychology researchers to move their laboratory research toward continuous response paradigms.},

Learning dramatically reorganized neuronal tuning properties at both the single unit and population levels, resulting in the emergence of sharply-tuned representations of numerosity in the IPS layer. Ablation analysis revealed that spontaneous number neurons observed prior to learning were not critical to formation of number representations post-learning. Crucially, multidimensional scaling of population responses revealed the emergence of absolute and relative magnitude representations of quantity, including mid-point anchoring. These learnt representations may underlie changes from logarithmic to cyclic and linear mental number lines that are characteristic of number sense development in humans. Our findings elucidate mechanisms by which learning builds novel representations supporting number sense.},

We examine human performance on variations of the optimal stopping problem, with diﬀerent environments and with diﬀerent goals. Speciﬁcally, we consider environments that have relatively high or low numbers, under the goals of choosing the maximum or the minimum. A natural consequence of this design is that we study the decisions that people make in both congruent situations, where the environment and goal align, and incongruent situations, where the environment and goal diﬀer. First, we present empirical evidence that people adapt to both high and low environments as well as to both maximum and minimum goal frames, and that they make decisions consistent with using thresholdbased models. Secondly, we apply a previously-developed threshold model of individual performance to our data, inferring the thresholds people use. Lastly, we use Bayes factors to test whether people are sensitive to environments, goals, and congruency in optimal stopping problems. Overall, our results suggest that there are psychological similarities in congruent situations, pointing towards invariances and rationalities in the way people solve optimal stopping problems as the environments and goals change, without contaminating framing eﬀects.},

	abstract = {Using Bayesian methods to apply computational models of cognitive processes, or Bayesian cognitive modeling, is an important new trend in psychological research. The rise of Bayesian cognitive modeling has been accelerated by the introduction of software that efficiently automates the Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling used for Bayesian model fitting — including the popular Stan and PyMC packages, which automate the dynamic Hamiltonian Monte Carlo and No-U-Turn Sampler (HMC/NUTS) algorithms that we spotlight here. Unfortunately, Bayesian cognitive models can struggle to pass the growing number of diagnostic checks required of Bayesian models. If any failures are left undetected, inferences about cognition based on the model’s output may be biased or incorrect. As such, Bayesian cognitive models almost always require troubleshooting before being used for inference. Here, we present a deep treatment of the diagnostic checks and procedures that are critical for effective troubleshooting, but are often left underspecified by tutorial papers. After a conceptual introduction to Bayesian cognitive modeling and HMC/NUTS sampling, we outline the diagnostic metrics, procedures, and plots necessary to detect problems in model output with an emphasis on how these requirements have recently been changed and extended. Throughout, we explain how uncovering the exact nature of the problem is often the key to identifying solutions. We also demonstrate the troubleshooting process for an example hierarchical Bayesian model of reinforcement learning, including supplementary code. With this comprehensive guide to techniques for detecting, identifying, and overcoming problems in fitting Bayesian cognitive models, psychologists across subfields can more confidently build and use Bayesian cognitive models in their research.},

We model decision-making in tasks with multielement displays as evidence accumulation by a vector-valued diffusion process in a hypersphere, whose radius represents the decision criterion for the task. We show that the methods used to derive response time and accuracy predictions for the 2D model can be applied, with only minor changes, to predict performance in higher-dimensional spaces as well. We apply the model to the double-target deficit paradigm of Duncan (Psychological Review, 87, 272–300: 1980) in which participants judge whether briefly presented four-element displays contain one- or two-digit targets among letter distractors. A 4D version of the hyperspherical diffusion model correctly predicted distributions of response times and response accuracy as a function of task difficulty in single-target and double-target versions of the task. The estimated drift rate parameters from the model imply that the mental representation of the decision alternatives, which we term the “decision template” for the task, encodes configural stimulus properties that reflect the number of targets in the display. Along with its application to multielement decision-making, the model has the potential to characterize the speed and accuracy of multiattribute decisions in studies of cognitive categorization, visual attention, and other areas.},

Ex-Gaussian distributions and a diffusion model approach are used to describe individuals’ reaction time data. The authors identified common latent factors for each of the 3 ex-Gaussian parameters and for 3 parameters central to the diffusion model using structural equation modeling for a battery of choice reaction tasks. These factors had differential relations to criterion constructs. Parameters reflecting the tail of the distribution (i.e., ␶ in the ex-Gaussian and drift rate in the diffusion model) were the strongest unique predictors of working memory, reasoning, and psychometric speed. Theories of controlled attention and binding are discussed as potential theoretical explanations.},

	abstract = {Anybody who has some familiarity with the research literature in scientific psychology has probably thought, at one time or
another, ‘Well, all these means and correlations are very interesting, but what do they have to do with me, as an individual
person?’. The question, innocuous as it may seem, is a deep and complicated one. In contrast to the natural sciences, where
researchers can safely assume that, say, all electrons are exchangeable save properties such as location and momentum, people
differ from each other. Furthermore, it is not obvious that these differences can be treated as irrelevant to the structure
of the organisms in question, i.e., it is not clear that they can be treated as ‘noise’ or ‘error’. The problem permeates
virtually every subdiscipline of psychology, and in fact may be one of the reasons that progress in psychology has been limited.

	abstract = {From a computational perspective, the primary goal of cognitive science is to infer the influence of unobservable psychological constructs on observed behavioral data. Cognitive models can facilitate this inference by more directly expressing a theoretical cognitive processes through relationships among psychologically interpretable parameters. If cognitive models are developed in a hierarchical Bayesian framework, significantly more nuanced and complex theories may be expressed, thereby allowing for deeper insight into the nature of latent cognitive processes. Here, I highlight three specific benefits of a hierarchical Bayesian approach to cognitive modeling, with a special emphasis on model-based theory testing. First, after a brief introduction to Bayesian methods, I discuss how hierarchical modeling permits one to coherently analyze data from highly complex experimental designs. To demonstrate this first benefit, I describe how the development of a hierarchical Bayesian metaregression model inspired a new technique for quantitative assessment of the robustness of a psychological theory. Next, I describe how hierarchical modeling enables simultaneous implementation of multiple different styles of cognitive models, which permits theory testing at a higher level of abstraction. I demonstrate this through a cognitive latent variable model-based comparison of theories of attention ability. Finally, I discuss how hierarchical modeling can be used to express highly complex neurocognitive processes, as demonstrated through a new approach to joint modeling of neural and behavioral data that is better suited to hypothesis testing than previous approaches. Ultimately, I contend that hierarchical Bayesian cognitive modeling is an ideal way to perform more powerful and informative analyses of behavioral data by radically expanding the scope of questions we may ask about the nature of latent cognitive processes.},

Local independence, expected value true scores, and nondeterministic functions of observed variables are three types of definitions for latent variables. These definitions are reviewed and an alternative “sample realizations” definition is presented. Another section briefly describes identification, latent variable indeterminancy, and other properties common to models with latent variables. The paper then reviews the role of latent variables in multiple regression, probit and logistic regression, factor analysis, latent curve models, item response theory, latent class analysis, and structural equation models. Though these application areas are diverse, the paper highlights the similarities as well as the differences in the manner in which the latent variables are defined and used. It concludes with an evaluation of the different definitions of latent variables and their properties.},

Theoretical factors include the operationalist mode of thinking which is common throughout psychology, the dominance of classical test theory, and the use of “construct validity” as a catch-all category for a range of challenging psychometric problems. Pragmatic factors include the lack of interest in mathematically precise thinking in psychology, inadequate representation of psychometric modeling in major statistics programs, and insufficient mathematical training in the psychological curriculum. Substantive factors relate to the absence of psychological theories that are sufficiently strong to motivate the structure of psychometric models. Following the identification of these problems, a number of promising recent developments are discussed, and suggestions are made to further the integration of psychology and psychometrics.},

Short, to-the-point chapters offer examples, exercises, and computer code (using WinBUGS or JAGS, and supported by Matlab and R), with additional support available online. No advance knowledge of statistics is required and, from the very start, readers are encouraged to apply and adjust Bayesian analyses by themselves. The book contains a series of chapters on parameter estimation and model selection, followed by detailed case studies from cognitive science. After working through this book, readers should be able to build their own Bayesian models, apply the models to their own data, and draw their own conclusions.},

	abstract = {The incredible specificity and fidelity of human memory encoding is thought to be supported by a process known as pattern separation (Marr, 1971). Behaviorally, pattern separation has been measured using the Mnemonic Similarity Task (MST; (Stark, Kirwan, \& Stark, 2019)), an object recognition task with added similar “lure” images, from which a key metric, the Lure Discrimination Index (LDI) is calculated. Supported by an extensive literature validating its predictive power, this measure is gaining increasing use as a diagnostic of cognitive decline and neurological dysfunction. The exact mechanism through which this behavioral measure of pattern separation reflects the underlying neural computations is, however, unclear. In particular, choices alone cannot in principle distinguish the degree to which a given behavior results from signalbased discrimination of the object in question (i.e. the putative separated patterns) versus a more general tendency to inhibit or excite responses (e.g. response caution). Here, we distinguish these potentially co-contributing factors by modeling response times using a sequential sampling framework that identifies independent contributions to choices made by signal-noise discrimination and response thresholding. Across two independent datasets encompassing a lifespan sample (total N = 307, ages 8-89), we find that both factors reliably contribute to response behavior, though the signal-noise discrimination parameters (accumulator drift rates) explain a greater proportion of variance across all subjects. Further, we present evidence that both sets of parameters derived from response time modeling are more stable measures than those derived from choices alone.

We observed the effect in wirelike stimuli as well as in silhouettes (Experiment 1) and in complex, smoothed images as opposed to angular polygons (Experiment 2). We also observed a systematic effect of the magnitude of the change (Experiment 1). Furthermore, we find that the effect cannot be attributed to either local or global processing effects, but rather to a combination of both “mere” concaveness and an effect due to changes in the perceived part structure of the stimulus object (Experiment 3). For our data analysis, we used a nonparametric bootstrap method, which greatly increases sensitivity (compared to more traditional analyses like ANOVA).},
