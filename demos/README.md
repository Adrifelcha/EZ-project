/demos/

This folder contains the demo applications of the EZ Bayesian Hierarchical Drift-Diffusion Model (EZBHDDM) presented in our paper.

The folder is organized as follows:

    - /applications/:  Sample applications of our EZBHDDM to publicly available datasets
        - /applications/brightness_perception/:  
        - /applications/shape_perception/: 
  
    - /simulation-studies/:  Simulation studies used to evaluate the parameter recovery of our EZBHDDM
        - /simulation-studies/generative_priors/:  True parameter values were sampled from a generative prior distribution
        - /simulation-studies/generative_uniforms/:  True parameter values were sampled from suitable uniform distributions
        - /simulation-studies/hypothesis_testing/:
