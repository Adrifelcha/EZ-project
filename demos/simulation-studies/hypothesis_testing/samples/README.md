# demos/simulation-studies/hypothesis_testing/samples/

This folder is created by default.

Its purpose is to store the seed-specific output generated by the `runParallelSeeds.R` script, which include:

- Seed-specific `*_end.txt` and `*_start.txt` files used to indicate the end and start of each seed's execution.
- Seed-specific `.RData` files containing the MCMC samples and simulation settings (e.g., the list of true parameter values used) for each seed.
